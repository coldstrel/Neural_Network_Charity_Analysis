# Neural Network Model

## Overview of the analysis
For this analysis we are going to be using neural networks and machine learning to create a classifier to predict the success of the applicants in a charity. 

We are going to be using a CSV with data from more than 34,000 organizations that received funding by Alphabet Soup.


## Results
- Data Preprocessing
    - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model ?
    - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
    - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

- Compilign, Training and Evaluating the Model
    - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network, and why ?
    - Where you able to achieve the target model performance ?
    - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance ?
